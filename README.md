# Spur Gear CAM Project â€“ Fusion 360

This repository showcases my **first project in CAM and additive manufacturing**, designed and prepared entirely in **Fusion 360**. The main focus of this project is **CAM workflow for 3D printing**, including orientation, supports, slicing, and G-code generation.

## Project Overview
- Designed a **20-tooth spur gear** with:
  - Backlash for smooth meshing
  - Root fillet to reduce stress concentration
  - Hub for mounting on a shaft
- Developed a **parametric CAD model**: number of teeth, module, and hub dimensions can be easily modified
- Prepared a **CAM setup for additive manufacturing**:
  - Optimized orientation for minimal supports
  - Generated 3D-printable G-code for **Anycubic Mega Pro** using **ABS filament**
  - Configured layer height, infill, and support structures
  - 
## Skills Demonstrated
- CAM workflow in Fusion 360 (Additive Manufacturing)  
- Parametric CAD design  
- 3D printing preparation and G-code generation  
- Mechanical design principles (gear geometry, pitch, backlash, root fillets)  

## About the Project
This project marks my **first step into CAM for additive manufacturing**, focusing on **preparing a functional spur gear for 3D printing while optimizing the workflow for supports, orientation, and G-code generation**.
